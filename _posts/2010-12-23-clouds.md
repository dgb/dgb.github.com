The moon looks distorted by an astigmatic lens. Not quite full, but possibly round. It's orange when I first look at it, then the white balance of my eyes adjusts and it almost looks white. It's wearing a veil of thin clouds. As it rises and we move along, the clouds split and join (due to their differences in proximity).
They must be near us.
