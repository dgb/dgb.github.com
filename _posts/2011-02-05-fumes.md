Sitting on the tarmac, I could smell kerosene and peered out the window.
The telltale ghost's shadow of fumes flurried on the rubber stained
white concrete.

One time my uncle was dropping my sister and me off at Ottawa airport,
and I told him that it smelled like Tokyo. It must have been when I was
a teenager and had gone to Japan for the first time the year before. He
said something to the effect of "that's the smell of cities". I didn't
think much of it at the time, but in retrospect, he was probably
incorrect: I later found out that jet fuel is essentially kerosene,
also used for heating in Japan.

Sometime after that, I studied abroad in Tottori, a small town in an
epynomous prefecture. I'd take a city bus from my home to the city
center and walk to school every day. Despite stereotypes about Japanese
punctuality, my bus wasn't always on time, and I'd find myself reading
or, in the winter, just keeping my fingers warm. There were several
vending machines throughout the bus terminal, one of which sold hot
cocoa. They sold coffee too, but it was miserably weak (even as far as
vending machine coffee goes). So I'd buy a cocoa, thaw my hands, and
quaff its tooth-aching sweetness through the mixture of idling bus
exhaust and kerosene fumes carried on the cold wind.
