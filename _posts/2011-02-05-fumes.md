Sitting on the tarmac, I could smell kerosene and peered out the window. The telltale ghost's shadow of fumes flurried on the rubber stained white concrete.

One time my uncle was dropping me and my sister off at Ottawa airport,
and I told him that it smelled like Tokyo. I think it was when I was
a teenager and had gone to Japan for the first time the year before. He
said something to the effect of "that's the smell of cities". I didn't
think much of it at the time, but in retrospect, he was probably
incorrect, as I later found out that jet fuel is essentially kerosene.
Kerosene is also used for heating in Japan. But it was not just the
fumes, but also the way the cold wind carried them.

I remember sitting at a bus stop in Tottori in the winter. There were
several vending machines throughout the bus terminal outside the central
train station, one of which sold hot cocoa. They also sold coffee, but it was miserably weak even as far as vending machine coffee goes (the one at school was surprisingly adequate and cheap at 50 yen/cup, and helped me get through a lot of sleepy days. At first I wondered why the tea my host mother gave me wasn't doing the job. It was mugi-cha--barley tea--and though she mixed it with regular tea, it was likely not terribly strongly caffeinated). I sat waiting for the bus out to Kamidan, drinking hot cocoa.
