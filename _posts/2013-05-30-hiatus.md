Like many developers, I spend some of my free time working on software
projects on the side. The main project I've been working on for several
years is a photo editing application I've dubbed _Silver_[^1]. After
about five years of development, and many "pivots" and tweaks, I've
decided to discontinue working on it.

Many startup people advise that you "work on what you know" and "scratch
your own itch". Having a web-based raw image editor I'd wanted for
myself. Several years ago, sites like Facebook and Flickr were barely
able to handle full-resolution JPG images from digital SLRs, let alone
the massive RAW image files these cameras can pump out. Although
shooting RAW is a bit of a niche issue, I never regret it. It's like
shooting with good black and white film--even if your exposure is two
stops overexposed, you can pull[^3] out detail and make it look right.

Silver's design inspiration, even if not apparent in my prototypes, has
always been the test strip. I love film photography. Besides the ritual
of it all, there is a certain definitiveness to decisions you make. In
developing a print, you expose a strip of paper at increasingly longer
intervals, and then decide the exposure based on which looks good.

In a certain sense, it's been the opposite of the "lean" methodology. I
think there's something to be said for slowly working on something over
the years. For one, I'm a better programmer now, but also things I've
depended on have improved. For example, when I first started building
the version which worked with Dropbox, they had yet to add any sort of
delta endpoint to their API. While development was in a lull, they in
fact added it, and I even implemented the delta call in the [Ruby
Dropbox][4] library I ended up using.

Nonetheless there are an awful lot of challenges in developing a web
based raw processor:

* the large file sizes of raw images
* expensive rendering times (>1 second per jpg)
* proprietary nature of raw renderers[^2]

Although there's no product to show, I don't think developing Silver has
been for naught. I've learned a good amount of things, all of which I
think have some value:

* exposure to Cocoa APIs
* how launchd works
* using and developing gems across Ruby implementations
* setting up a testable service oriented architecture

I still think there is room for a different kind of photo editor. I may
continue working on Silver at some point in the future, though it'll
likely take a different form. I really like Paper for the iPad.
I have a feeling it would look something like that in taking the
analogue 'sense' of the interface without resorting to schmaltzy
skeumorphism.

I think, like a lot of developers, I've used my side projects to scratch
technical itches as well. I'm lucky enough to work in an
environment where I'm entrusted to do these sorts of techncial
experiments, and I believe I have enough experience to isolate the mad
science enough to keep things manageable but still fun.

In the meantime, I'm going to work on some non-software related side
projects. I've always liked cooking, and I've been doing a lot more of
that lately.

[^1]: I've given it, and its various components all kinds of names over
the years. Silver halide, as you may know, is a key ingredient in film
photography.

[^2]: I could write a piece on this alone. Although Windows now has
codecs built in through it's WIC thing, it's not available in the server
editions of Windows. MacOS has the best built in support. The dcraw project powers
just about everything else, and as impressive as it is, doesn't hold a
candle to the quality of the proprietary processors, especially on newer
(and rather popular) compact cameras that shoot raw but do extensive
lens corrections based on raw data.
