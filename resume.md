## Summary

I am a software developer with 9 years of professional experience.
Throughout my career, I've found myself working on every aspect of the
development process, from ideation and development to maintenance and
data analysis.

I am particularly interested in API design, automated testing, and
practical applications of functional programming concepts in imperative,
object-oriented languages.

## Freelance
### Software Engineer / Current

* Worked with **DentalDate** on their online dentist appointment system.
  I revamped their Braintree payment integration and built automated
  recurring billing features. I also lead efforts to improve the
  development process, including fixing the application's failing test
  suite, documenting its setup, implementing continuous integration and
  delivery, and formulating a code review process based on Github flow.
  I also upgraded the application's framework to Rails 5.

* Designed and prototyped a mobile toolkit application for healthcare
  providers with [Upstream USA](http://www.upstream.org) using React
  Native. Beyond building the application, I guided Upstream's
  leadership team in drawing up the technical specifications as well as
  devising a user testing plan.

## Shyp
### Software Engineer / 2016-2017

* Contributed to several profitability initiatives at Shyp, including
  the development of more reliable routing and route instrumentation
  systems, as well as a scheduling system to complement the on-demand
  platform.

* Lead efforts to modernize many aspects of our infrastructure,
  including moving several API services to Convox, as well as migrating
  text-based ids to native UUIDs. I wrote [a blog post][blog] about the
  latter.

* Experimented with novel approaches to problems, including using
  image-recognition technology to estimate shipping pricing, as well as
  prototyping a push-based event bus to replace instances of application
  polling.

## Merus
### Engineering Consultant / 2015

* Lead design and development of **Merus**'s public API, written
  with Node.js against a legacy MySQL database. Delivered a first
  version to external clients within three months, opening a new revenue
  stream with the company's partners in the legal space. Also
  contributed patches to upstream `sequelize` and `node-mysql`
  libraries.

* Built an exploratory profile service **Merus.me** for attorneys,
  serving as a marketing engine, while also doubling as a test bed for
  developing the next version of the MerusCase front-end. The
  application is a universal React application with an Express backend.

## Cadre
### Founder / CTO 2014-2015

* Developed **Cadre**, an iOS application for connecting people to jobs
  through their existing social networks. Generated interest early on at
  companies like Match and Heroku, and interviewed with Y Combinator.

* Built several other prototype applications in the hiring space,
  including one based on an auction model, one focused on freelancers,
  and another centered around modern "makers".

## OkCupid Labs / Match.com

### Engineer at Large 2013-2014

Served as an internal consultant on various projects in the Match
organization including:

* Separating SpeedDate.com's new Ember.js front-end from its legacy
  PHP backend, and helping devise a migration from its legacy backend to
  the API that powers Match.com.

* Designing and building a lead generation system responsible for
  handling large campaigns across Match, SpeedDate, OkCupid and other
  portfolio brands. The system incorporated a simple JavaScript API and
  client enabling junior front-end developers to test and launch various
  campaigns easily.

* Experimenting with using Natural Language Processing to cluster
  Match.com users into interest-based groups using Mahout.

### Senior Software Engineer 2011-2013

* Organized engineering efforts for **Delightful.com**, a concierge
  service providing couples with tailored dates. The site was primarily
  a content management and inventory customization system built on Ruby
  on Rails and powered by Stripe.

* Spearheaded development of **Essentially.im**, to launch a
  mutual-selection dating application to iTunes in three weeks, despite
  none of the engineers (including myself) having never touched the iOS
  SDK. The Sinatra backend utilized Postgres's `LISTEN/NOTIFY`, a
  Celluloid-based message router, and Rack's hijack API for real-time
  chat.

* Lent expertise in building JavaScript single page apps in order to
  ship the initial iterations of **Crashpad**, a roommate finding
  application.

Led an internal tools and services team to design and build:

* An auth service handling **Kiss.com**'s 12M legacy logins and
  thousands of daily users. Prioritized the developer UX of the service,
  by allowing it to be easily mounted in and run against the host
  application's test suite.

* Social data parsing and warehousing services that would provide
  photographic information for **Ravel** and a taxonomic groundwork for
  **Opal.io.**

* An open source Redis-backed tagging library named
  [Dank](https://github.com/zenkalia/dank) used by **Ravel** and
  **Twohodo**.

## Fuery Solutions
### Software Engineer 2008-2011

* Helped bootstrap a profitable web-based case-management system,
  **MerusCase**, utilizing a thick-client JavaScript application, a PHP
  API, and several Ruby microservices.

* Provided contract services for a number of businesses, including an
  adventure travel e-commerce site, a location based
  event-recommendation widget, and a web-based music video editor.
